Idiot check for ScreenSharing

purpose: indicates if Sharing Preferences: Screen Sharing / VNC is permitted to
    this machine

daemons:
    /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/screensharingd.bundle/Contents/MacOS/screensharingd
    /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ScreensharingAgent.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ScreensharingAgent

requirement: ScreenSharing permits remote console/interactive access.

info:
Detecting this is tricky because until it's accessed neither of the above are
forked as processes visible in process table. Once a system has been accessed,
though, these processes remain until Sharing:Screen Sharing is disabled

 Might need to read defaults or a plist instead.
 $ sudo lsof -n -i:5900
 is also good but insane

 Actually the *right* way to do this is by calling launchctl

 $ launchctl list

 $ launchctl print system/com.apple.screensharing state

If it's enabled then properties will be returned including

state = waiting

Which seems to indicate it's configured to spawn screensharingd
If it's not enabled in Sharing prefs nothing will be returned

$ launchctl print system/com.apple.screensharing state
Could not find service "com.apple.screensharing" in domain for system
